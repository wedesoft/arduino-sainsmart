# arduino-sainsmart [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/wedesoft/arduino-sainsmart.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/wedesoft/arduino-sainsmart)


[Arduino][1] software to steer the SainSmart [DIY 6-axis palletizing robot arm][2] and [Sunfounder Rollpaw gripper][15].

![Smooth motion profiles](profile.png)

The software uses smooth *sin²(t)* (where t is the time) speed profiles to drive the robot joints.
At any time the sum of up to two speed profiles is output to the drives.
Using *sin²(t)+cos²(t)=1* one can achieve constant motion.
The plot shows jerk (blue), acceleration (red), speed (green), and position (magenta).

Altogether the equipment cost is about 200£.
Furthermore you need a PC with a USB port.

## software build

First install the dependencies. Please refer to the file *.travis.yml* for more information.

Create the initial calibration file with the limits and offsets of each servo:

```
cp calibration.hh.default calibration.hh
```

Then build the Arduino program using *make*:

```
make
```

Note: You might have to change the *BOARD_TAG* in the *arduino/Makefile*.
See */usr/share/arduino/hardware/arduino/boards.txt* for supported board tags.

## software test

You can also build and run the tests on the *PC* using the check target:

```
make check
```

## install on Arduino

The upload target will upload the program via */dev/ttyUSB0* to the *Arduino* board.

```
make upload
```

**Warning: program the board before connecting the servos the first time to prevent erratic motion!**

**Warning: once servos are plugged into the board, always connect the servo power to the DFRobot I/O expansion shield before connecting the USB cable to the Arduino to prevent the board power from stalling which causes erratic motion!**

**Warning: self-collisions or collisions with the surface and other objects can damage the servos!**

You can then adjust the limits and offsets for your robot and then compile and upload the modified software.

## control robot

You can control the robot using the *screen* serial terminal (make sure *ttyUSB0* is the correct port):

```
screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
```

Examples of servo commands are:

* **o**: check whether drives are ready to receive more commands (1=ready, 0=busy)
* **t**: get time
* **b**: get base servo angle
* **s**: get shoulder servo angle
* **e**: get elbow servo angle
* **r**: get roll servo angle
* **p**: get pitch servo angle
* **w**: get wrist servo angle
* **g**: get gripper servo angle
* **B**: get base servo pulse width
* **S**: get shoulder servo pulse width
* **E**: get elbow servo pulse width
* **R**: get roll servo pulse width
* **P**: get pitch servo pulse width
* **W**: get wrist servo pulse width
* **G**: get gripper servo pulse width
* **c**: get current configuration (base, shoulder, elbow, roll, pitch, and wrist)
* **l**: get lower limits for servos
* **u**: get upper limits for servos
* **45b**: set base servo angle to 45 degrees
* **-12.5s**: set shoulder servo angle to -12.5 degrees
* **10e**: set elbow servo angle to 10 degrees
* **20r**: set roll servo angle to 20 degrees
* **30p**: set pitch servo angle to 30 degrees
* **40w**: set wrist servo angle to 40 degrees
* **0g**: set gripper servo angle to 0 degrees
* **2400B**: set base servo pulse width to 2400
* **1500S**: set shoulder servo pulse width to 1500
* **720E**: set elbow servo pulse width to 720
* **1500R**: set roll servo pulse width to 1500
* **1500P**: set pitch servo pulse width to 1500
* **1500W**: set wrist servo pulse width to 1500
* **2000G**: set gripper servo pulse width to 2000
* **1 2 3 4 5 6c**: set configuration (base, shoulder, elbow, roll, pitch, and wrist) to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 degrees
* **1 2 3 4 5 6t**: time required to reach the specified configuration
* **T**: report time required to finish current motion
* **ma**: save teach point *a* (there are 12 teach points from *a* to *l*)
* **'a**: go to teach point *a*
* **da**: display configuration of teach point *a*
* **x**: stop all servos (in fact any undefined key should do)

You can exit the *screen* terminal using Ctrl-A \\.

**Warning: self-collisions of the robot can damage the servos!**

## XBox controller

You can control the robot using a calibrated XBox controller.

```
ruby control.rb
```

Note that for some reason you sometimes need to run the serial terminal first, press *t* a few times, and then exit for the Arduino to wake up.
